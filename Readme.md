# Merch-Mania 

MerchMania is an ecommerce solution for a niche market for fans of anime and videogame merchandise. This solution will provide an easy way for end
users to be able to represent their favorite topics. Ultimatley this will be a secure solution to buy products I will also be adding the ability 
for Admin users to have a dashboard to create items and add them for purchase. This will also be helped by providing statistics in order to see the
most popular items. My target audience is teens, young adults , and adults.
